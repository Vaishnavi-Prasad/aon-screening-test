Following will be my review comments for the above code:

    1. The method has too many nested If statements , code needs to be readable and easier to follow. Suggestion : refactor code by reducing the nested Ifs
    2. String cannot be compared with "==" as it checks for reference equality not value . Suggestion : Use equals() method
    3. The current method name is vague and does not clearly convey its functionality. Suggestion : Using a clear method name that describes the functionality
    4. The method does not handle scenarios where the student object might be null. Suggestion: Add a null check for the student object at the start of the method to ensure robustness.
