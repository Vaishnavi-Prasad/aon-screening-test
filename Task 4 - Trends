Trend :

    A major trend that has happened in the last few years is adoption of microservices architecture, cloud based solutions ,containerization and automation .

Influence on Corporate Application Development:

    Microservices and cloud-native development improve scalability and flexibility, allowing faster updates and quicker responses to market changes.
    This approach optimizes resource use, reduces costs, and lets developers focus on innovation while cloud providers manage operations.

 Preparing for the trend:

    I am committed to continuous learning and upskilling to stay current with industry trends.
    Iâ€™ve been exploring cloud platforms, understanding their services, and learning how to leverage containerization.
    I am also focusing on how to efficiently migrate monolithic applications to microservices, including the key considerations and best practices for designing such architectures.
    To support my growth, I regularly read newsletters and enroll in relevant courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera.
